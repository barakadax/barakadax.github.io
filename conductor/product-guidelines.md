# Product Guidelines

## Visual Style and Tone
- Dark mode with a developer-focused aesthetic.
- Creative and interactive elements (animations, unique layout) to engage users.
- Maintained professional appearance suitable for recruiters and hiring managers.

## Branding and Color Scheme
- Adhere to the existing color scheme:
  - Primary: Orange (#ff8c00)
  - Background: Black/Dark (#000000)
  - Accents: Blue (as seen in `css-doodle` styles)
- Use high-contrast colors for accessibility and developer aesthetic.
